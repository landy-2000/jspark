<p><strong>February</strong>, professional surfer Maya Gabeira of Brazil participated in a surfing championship in Portugal. During the event, the 33-year-old athlete found herself surfing especially fast. Although she could not see the wave behind her, she felt it was a special one.</p>
<p style="margin-top:80px;""><U>When her ride was over and the wave finally crashed</U>, it made a tremendous sound. Gabeira guessed the wave was the biggest she had ever ridden. She was right.</P>
<p>The wave measured 22.4 meters in height. In September, Guinness World Records confirmed that it was the tallest wave ever surfed by a woman. Furthermore, it was the tallest wave surfed by anyone so far in 2020.
It was a significant moment for female athletes. Gabeira hopes her achievement proves how competitive women can be in sports.</P>
